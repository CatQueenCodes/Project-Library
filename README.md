This project took me 37 hours, 1.3 hours of that time was CSS the rest was the JavaScript

Things I learned:\
-How to properly use `const`\
-Basics of local storage so data is not lost on page refresh\
-You can access DOM elements with a variable refrencing that DOM elements ID. For example: \
let bookId = document.getElementById(`readBtn${myLibrary.indexOf(this)}`); to access an element with the ID `readBtn1`\
-You can add event listeners INSIDE of other functions.\
-`!` NOT will turn truthy values falsey and falsey values truthy. You can change a variable/value using `!`
